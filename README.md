# World-Economic-Indicators
Analysis of indicators of economic performance and development from 1960-2018.

## Project Description 
This project involves analysis of the World Economic Indicators dataset sourced from the World Bank website. The analysis was performed using Python in Visual Studio Code. The dataset provides vital insights into global economic performance and development trends from 1960 to 2018. Key indicators include GDP per capita, electricity consumption, life expectancy, and more. The visualization are made in Tableau.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze key economic indicators to uncover meaningful trends, correlations, and regional disparities. The goal is to understand how different factors like GDP per capita, electricity consumption, and internet penetration vary across income groups, regions, and countries, and how these relate to development and quality of life.

## Visualizations and Insights

## GDP Per Capita by Income Groups

This chart shows the trends in GDP per capita for five income groups.
- High-income non-OECD and High-income OECD groups exhibit the highest average GDP per capita, surpassing $40,000 at their peak.
- By 2018, the average GDP per capita for these groups stands at around $30,000.
- Low-income groups, on the other hand, have consistently remained below $1,000, reflecting a stark disparity in economic performance.

## Correlation Between Economic Indicators

- Luxembourg leads with an average GDP per capita of $76,000, a life expectancy of 78 years, and an average unemployment rate of 3.96%.
- As GDP per capita declines, unemployment rates increase significantly.
- Interestingly, life expectancy appears to be less impacted by GDP per capita and unemployment, suggesting its dependency on geographic and healthcare factors.

## Internet Penetration Across Regions

- North America has the highest internet penetration, with 54% of its population online.
- Europe & Central Asia follow with 38% penetration.
- Sub-Saharan Africa lags significantly at just 6%, indicating a digital divide.

## Global Population Density by Region

- East Asia & Pacific leads with a staggering 896 people per square kilometer of land area.
- Europe & Central Asia and North America follow, with densities of 374 and 369, respectively.

## Top 10 Countries by GDP

- The USA tops the list with a GDP exceeding $20 trillion in 2018.
- China and Japan rank second and third, respectively, showcasing the prominence of these economies.

## GDP Per Capita and Electricity Consumption

- Norway stands out with the highest average electricity consumption of 19,782 kWh per capita.
- Western countries tend to consume significantly more electricity than those in the Global South.
Further research indicates two main reasons:
1. Cold climates in European countries necessitate extensive heating.
2. Larger economies with higher GDP per capita result in greater energy consumption.

## Key Findings
- Economic Disparities: High-income groups enjoy significantly higher GDP per capita compared to low-income groups, which remain below $1,000.
- Unemployment and GDP Correlation: Lower GDP per capita is associated with higher unemployment, but life expectancy remains relatively stable across income levels.
- Regional Economic Powerhouses: The USA, China, and Japan dominate global GDP rankings.
- Population Density Variations: East Asia & Pacific regions have the highest population densities, indicating significant regional disparities.
- Digital Divide: Internet penetration is highest in developed regions like North America but remains minimal in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Energy Consumption Trends: Western countries consume more electricity due to colder climates and stronger economies, highlighting regional disparities in energy use.
